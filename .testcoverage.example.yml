# (mandatory) 
# Path to coverage profile file (output of `go test -coverprofile` command).
#
# For cases where there are many coverage profiles, such as when running 
# unit tests and integration tests separately, you can combine all those
# profiles into one. In this case, the profile should have a comma-separated list 
# of profile files, e.g., 'cover_unit.out,cover_integration.out'.
profile: cover.out

# Holds coverage thresholds percentages, values should be in range [0-100].
threshold:
  # (optional; default 0) 
  # Minimum coverage percentage required for individual files.
  file: 70

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # Minimum coverage percentage required for each package.
  package: 80

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # Minimum overall project coverage percentage required.
  total: 95

# Holds regexp rules which will override thresholds for matched files or packages 
# using their paths.
#
# First rule from this list that matches file or package is going to apply 
# new threshold to it. If project has multiple rules that match same path, 
# override rules should be listed in order from specific to more general rules.
override:
  # Increase coverage threshold to 100% for `foo` package 
  # (default is 80, as configured above in this example).
  - path: ^pkg/lib/foo$
    threshold: 100

# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages 
# from coverage statistics.
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    - \.pb\.go$    # excludes all protobuf generated files
    - ^pkg/bar     # exclude package `pkg/bar`

# If specified, saves the current test coverage breakdown to this file.

# Typically, this breakdown is generated only for main (base) branches and 
# stored as an artifact. Later, this file can be used in feature branches 
# to compare test coverage against the base branch.

diff:
  # Path to the test coverage breakdown file from the base branch.
  #
  # This file is usually generated and stored in the main (base) branch,
  # controled via `breakdown-file-name` property.
  # When set in a feature branch, it allows the tool to compute and report 
  # the coverage difference between the current (feature) branch and the base.

  # Allowed threshold for the test coverage difference (in percentage) 
  # between the feature branch and the base branch.
  #
  # By default, this is disabled (set to null). Valid values range from 
  # -100.0 to +100.0.
  #
  # Example: 
  #   If set to 0.5, an error will be reported if the feature branch has 
  #   less than 0.5% more coverage than the base.
  #
  #   If set to -0.5, the check allows up to 0.5% less coverage than the base.
