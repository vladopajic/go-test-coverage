# Contribution

All contributions are welcome - whether you're fixing a typo, adding a new feature, or reporting an issue. Feel free to open a pull request or create an issue to contribute!


## PR Guidelines

Before requesting a review, please ensure that your code passes the following checks:

- unit tests: `make test`
- coverage: `make check-coverage`
- lints: `make lint`

Once all checks have passed, you may request a review from the maintainers (@vladopajic).
