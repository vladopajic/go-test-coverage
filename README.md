`go-test-coverage` is tool which reports issues when test coverage is below set threshold.

## Why?

These are the most important features and benefits of `go-test-coverage`:

- easy installation - ready in 5 minutes
- server-less
  - no registration, no permissions needed
  - check never fails due to connectivity/server issues
- **protects privacy** - will never leak any information about your private projects to third parties 
- supports usage in local and CI environments
- comprehensive configuration options
- fancy badges

## Usage

`go-test-coverage` can be used in two ways:
 - as local tool, and/or
 - as step of github workflow

It is recommended to have both options in go repositories.

### Local tool

Example of `Makefile` which has `check-coverage` command that runs `go-test-coverage` locally:

```makefile
GOBIN ?= $$(go env GOPATH)/bin

.PHONY: install-go-test-coverage
install-go-test-coverage:
	go install github.com/vladopajic/go-test-coverage/v2@latest

.PHONY: check-coverage
check-coverage: install-go-test-coverage
	go test ./... -coverprofile=./cover.out -covermode=atomic
	${GOBIN}/go-test-coverage --config=./.testcoverage.yml
```

### Github Workflow

Example to run `go-test-coverage` as step of workflow:


```yml
name: Go test coverage check
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: actions/setup-go@v3
  
  - name: generate test coverage
    run: go test ./... -coverprofile=./cover.out

  - name: check test coverage
    uses: vladopajic/go-test-coverage@v2
    with:
      # Configure action using config file (option 1)
      config: ./.testcoverage.yml
      
      # Configure action by specifying input parameters individually (option 2)
      profile: cover.out
      local-prefix: github.com/org/project
      threshold-file: 80
      threshold-package: 80
      threshold-total: 95
```

### Config

Example of [.testcoverage.yml](./.testcoverage.example.yml) config file:

```yml
# (mandatory) 
# Path to coverprofile file (output of `go test -coverprofile` command)
profile: cover.out

# (optional) 
# When specified reported file paths will not contain local prefix in the output
local-prefix: "github.com/org/project"

# Holds coverage thresholds percentages, values should be in range [0-100]
threshold:
  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum coverage that each file should have
  file: 80

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum coverage that each package should have
  package: 80

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum total coverage project should have
  total: 95

# Holds regexp rules which will override thresholds for matched files or packages
override:
  # Increase coverage threshold to 100% for `foo` package (default is 80, as configured above)
  - threshold: 100
    path: ^pkg/lib/foo$

# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages from coverage statistics
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    - \.pb\.go$    # excludes all protobuf generated files
    - ^pkg/bar     # exclude package `pkg/bar`
 
# NOTES:
# - symbol `/` in all path regexps will be replaced by
#   current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows
```

## Coverage Badge

Repositories which use `go-test-coverage` action in their workflows could easily create beautiful coverage badge and embed them in markdown files (eg. ![coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladopajic/go-test-coverage/badges/.badges/main/coverage.svg)).

Read instructions on creating coverage badge [here](./docs/badge.md).
